# TradeGenius: AI-Powered Stock Research Assistant
Short description of project. Replace this and the project section below with a 1-3 sentence description of your project. 

Project Notes:

- Please remember to keep your repo private when you create it from this template.
- Be sure to create your report in the **intro-gen-ai** organization. 
- The name of the repo should be the name of the project, or a shortened version of the name.
- Each section should be completed by the deadline indicated. You submit by making a commit of this README.md file. Except for minor edits, please do no change the Proposal, Goals, or Metrics sections after the submission deadline.
- General guidance on formatting writing in markdown files (like this README.md file) is at https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax.
- There is a [recording of the the class discussion on the use of this template](https://vanderbilt.zoom.us/rec/share/RjihScz0Ti7RId0KMj7GWBc8XueS571_JnFqDQwli0AuKLsgaau0j_RcphBjwYtV.HP10ROf2TwPUn6TA?startTime=1697553005000).
- You can sign up for a time to discuss your ideas for the project at https://calendly.com/jesse-spencer-smith. We'll also be discussing project in class on Tuesday after Fall Break.
- Remember that there is an AI Showcase on April 19 (with prizes for Best in Show), so you might want to consider completing your project by then.

### Description of Problem/Opportunity
Description of Problem/Opportunity

In the realm of stock trading, having access to comprehensive and accurate research is vital for both personal and professional traders. However, conducting thorough market research is time-consuming and requires expertise in analyzing various sources of information, including Wall Street analyst reports, market sentiments, and trading rules. Many traders, especially those with limited time or expertise, struggle to keep up with the vast amount of data available and may make suboptimal decisions as a result. There is a significant opportunity to leverage artificial intelligence to streamline the research process and provide traders with actionable insights to inform their trading decisions.

### Proposed Solution/Approach
Our proposed solution is to develop a sophisticated AI-powered stock research assistant that will conduct in-depth market analysis on behalf of traders. This AI assistant will utilize web search capabilities to gather information from credible sources, including Wall Street analyst reports, financial news outlets, and reputable market analysis platforms. Using natural language processing (NLP) algorithms, the system will parse through the gathered data to extract relevant insights and sentiment analysis to gauge market sentiment.

The AI assistant will incorporate a variety of metrics, including data provided by credible Wall Street and analyst companies, sentimental analyses, and established trading rules, to generate a comprehensive research report. It will analyze the positive, negative, and neutral sentiments from various sources to provide a balanced view of market opinions. Additionally, the assistant will present multiple scenarios to help traders understand potential outcomes and make informed decisions.

Furthermore, the AI assistant will employ machine learning algorithms to continuously improve its accuracy and effectiveness over time. By analyzing past market trends and the outcomes of previous trading decisions, the system will learn to identify patterns and make more accurate predictions. It will also adapt to changes in market conditions and incorporate new information to ensure that traders have access to the most up-to-date insights.

### Project Outline and Timeline

**Milestones:**

- **3/28:** Complete project outline and identify the necessary databases for the AI assistant. Begin development of initial components of the Assistant.
  
- **4/4:** Acquire all required data and integrate it into the AI Assistant. Implement prompts for specific aspects of the scouting report generation.
  
- **4/11:** Enable the assistant to autonomously generate a full scouting report based on the fed-in data. Test and debug as necessary.
  
- **4/18:** Refine the assistant's capabilities, addressing any potential errors or inaccuracies. Enhance the assistant's ability to incorporate new data for future reports.
  
- **4/22:** Finalize development and testing of the AI assistant. Ensure it is ready for use by personal and professional traders.

### Goals of the Project

Goal 1: Design a customized generative AI-powered stock research assistant capable of conducting in-depth market analysis on behalf of traders.

Goal 2: Utilize data gathered from credible sources, including Wall Street analyst reports, financial news outlets, and reputable market analysis platforms.

Goal 3: Incorporate sentiment analysis to gauge market sentiment and present a balanced view of market opinions, including positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.

Goal 4: Generate comprehensive research reports incorporating metrics from credible sources and established trading rules to provide traders with actionable insights and multiple scenarios for informed decision-making.

Goal 5: Include possible uncertainity and error it might commit. If it is unclear it should point out that.

Yes, I plan on continuing the project by utilizing Customized GPT to create my final project. The prompting skills I have gained from class are greatly assisting me in this project. Knowing how to prompt a customized GPT enable me to establish metrics and other parameters for the project effectively. While it's unlikely that I'll use any coding or external tools I learned in class other than OpenAI's customized GPT, I am still open to using them in case I decide to do so. I also plan to use dall-e to help users with visualization of reports it provides, if applicable.
